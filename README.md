### FileBot workflow

This is my [FileBot](http://filebot.net) workflow which automatically renames and hardlinks completed Transmission downloads. It uses a modified version of [rednoah's Automated Media Center](http://www.filebot.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=215) script.

### Git workflow

When rednoah updates his Automated Media Center script, commit his changes the `rednoah` branch. Then merge those changes into `master`.
